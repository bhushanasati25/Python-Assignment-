    "\n",

    "            2.Function is a piece of code or any logic that performs the specific operation.\n",
    "            3.It helps to divide the large programs into small groups so that we can read the code, and debug the program faster and better.\n",
    "            4.Python Functions stop us from writing the same logic various times. We can bind the logic in one function and then call the same over and over."

The statements after the return statements are not executed. If the return statement is without any expression, then the special value None is returned.\n",
